# SortingAlgorithms

This is implementation of diffrent sorting algorithms. Currently we have implemented Mergesort, Bubblesort, Introsort and Quicksort.
There are also apllied functions to generate our arrays in special format (for example sorted in reverse at begining, or sorted only part of array).
Project was made while learning standard Python functions and thats why a lot of things can be implemented better. I have paln to develop this project
and rewrite implementation using multiprocessing
