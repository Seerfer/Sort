# SortingAlgorithms

This programs is created to test effectiveness of diffrent sorting algorithms.
For this day it  has implamented quicksort, mergesort and bubblesort.
It can be tested in diffrent conditions. We can choose how many arrays 
we want to sort, how many numbers will be in singel array. Moreover we can 
sort a part of first elements before testing it, or we can sort it in reverse.
